whic modul how worck I know and how write sorce code i konow but i dont know how BUILD Structure of my program
need automatisation of
1 stat 
choise temerature of heating to 150 C then by rottery Encoder
continue keaping 150 C
start conter down timer of 25 min choisen by rottery Encoder
after end timer shut down heating
I don't know how to write the code because in this way it will perform each function until its completion and I need to push the parameters and work in another cycle or function
